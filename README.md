# How do i get started knowing this language

If your fammiliar from learning from a pre-made game, there are some games in the,
examples folder for you to try.

# Why is it 1.5 not 1.0?

1.0 is the old, slow static version, seen on https://ggm2community.glitch.me/editor/ but this version is ported and edited to work in gvbvdxx-pack, a js compiler to compile js code and put it into a single script, of corse designed by me.
1.0 is slow since its resources need to be fetched multiple times (that need to be loaded in order to function), however 1.5 only needs to fetch less resources (that need to be loaded in order to function), so it has a faster loading time, all you can see is white then a sudden blue ggm2 appears, no loading screen!
